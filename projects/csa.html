    <h1>NEU's Chinese Student Association</h1>
    <h4>Northeastern University's Chinese Student Association is a student organization that supports 
      awareness of Chinese and Chinese American culture and strives to unite students of all backgrounds interested 
      in Chinese American heritage through general meetings and larger events.</h4>

    <h4>As the sole designer for the Chinese Student Association on campus this 
      past academic year, I was tasked with all things involving media for the club, 
      including designing posters, social media marketing material, club cards, club apparel, etc.,
      as well as taking photos and videos during events. Here is some of the work I  
      produced during my time as designer for the club! </h4>
