    <h1>Paperless</h1>
    <h4>Paperless is an application that allows users to easily track their physical
    receipts and access data that is relevant to their spending habits. Through Optical
    Capture Recognition, a technology which is able to parse an image of a physical receipt
    into raw data, Paperless is able to store this data as individual entries, as well as
    visualize meaningful data.</h4>
    <h4>The inspiration for Paperless came to me as I was thinking of problems that did not yet have a solution.
    Then, one day, when I wished to return a piece of clothing to a store, I realized I couldn't because I had no 
    idea where I had put the receipt. Paperless offers a solution to this, as a receipt tracking platform, in
    addition to the meaningful data it offers to users about their spending. Created for Interaction Design 1 final project.</h4>
    <h4>Other topics of further exploration within this project could include exactly what data is most meaningful to users, as
    well as how to most effectively visually display this data.</h4>
